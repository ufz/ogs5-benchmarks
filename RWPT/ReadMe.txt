For the benchmark test application, only Veri1000 is added to the benchmark script. This is to prevent unnecessary computational resource in testing benchmark problems.

In the RWPT folder of the repository, there is RWPT-Accuracy.tar.gz. This file is compressed to have all the simulation files used to produce the results used in the paper submitted to Advances in Water Resources. It is "An efficient method of random walk particle tracking: accuracy and resolution".

The file contains path line simulation on two different grids that consists of quadlateral and triangle elements. As for quadlateral elements, several different boundary conditions are used for simulation.

The file also contains simulations of particle resolution in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. 

Note that the file contains various files of the simulation results that can be viewed by excel, surfer, and grapher.
